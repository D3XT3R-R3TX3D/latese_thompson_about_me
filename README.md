# latese_thompson_about_me
This is just a small portion of who Latese is.
She is super driven with many obtainable goals in her view and she will not stop until she obtains them.
We share many interests and similar upbringings, and I enjoyed explaining the different cultures in New York City to her.
I wanted to highlight some of the things I took from our conversation, but I'm positive Latese is constantly growing as a person, 
so this page would have to be updated periodically.
I had asked Latese if there was anything she would want on this page and not only did she give me free reign to design it however 
I wanted to, she has expressed that it should be simple and not anything too out of the ordinary.
I share the same sentiment, so I tried to do her justice with this layout.
I chose these colors simply because dark blue is often used to represent elegance, authority, and intelligence.
Orange because I knew I wanted to add Garfield to the page for comedic effect and show off personality.
I took the picture that was on her slack and cropped it so that I can add the rounded edges on it and make it front and center.
Finally, I added the East Orange, New Jersey map in to show heritage, which is a big part of what makes a person unique.
